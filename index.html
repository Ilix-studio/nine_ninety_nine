        <h1>A Heartfelt Apology</h1>
        <p>
          It's been <span class="days">999</span> days since we last spoke, and
          the weight of that silence has been crushing me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I know that no amount of words can make up for the time lost, but I
          hope my sincerity reaches your heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          I miss your laugh, your wisdom, and the way you saw the world in
          colors I never knew existed.
        </p>
        <p class="highlight">
          I've spent 999 days regretting not reaching out sooner, and I don't
          want to spend another day without your friendship in my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm not asking for things to be exactly as they were, just for a
          chance to rebuild what was once special between us.
